# FeatureToggle.Azure ![Build Status](https://mny.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/e5e58460-9355-4047-acb5-e748049e304b/29/badge)
**FeatureToggle.Azure** is a collection of [FeatureToggle](https://github.com/jason-roberts/FeatureToggle) providers for various Azure services. The providers support centralized storage of feature toggles in Azure. For more information on how to implement and leverage features toggles, using FeatureToggle, see the [official docs for FeatureToggle](http://jason-roberts.github.io/FeatureToggle.Docs)

## List of Providers
- FeatureToggle Provider for Azure DocumentDB, ([learn more](#featuretoggleazuredocumentdb))
- FeatureToggle Provider for Azure Table storage, ([learn more](#featuretoggleazuretablestorage))
- FeatureToggle Provider for Service Fabric configuration packages, ([learn more](#featuretoggleazureservicefabric))

## FeatureToggle.Azure.DocumentDB
FeatureToggle provider for storing feature toggles as simple json documents in Azure DocumentDB (part of Azure Cosmos DB). The nuget package can be found on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle.Azure.DocumentDB/).

### Getting started
1. Install `FeatureToggle.Azure.DocumentDB` from nuget into your project.
2. Configure `DocumentDbProvider` at application startup, such as in Global.asax or Startup.cs by specifying the DocumentDb service uri and authentication key needed to store and retreive features toggles in DocumentDB. Global.asax example:
```c#
protected void Application_Start()
{
    // other startup configuration
    DocumentDbProvider.Configure("https://[serviceuri]", "[authkey]");
}
```
3. Add a class to your project representing the feature that needs to be controlled, e.g. `PrintFeature` and inherit from `DocumentDbToggle`
```c#
public class PrintFeature : DocumentDbToggle
{
}
```
4. Use the new feature toggle in your code to isolate features.
```c#
public ActionResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.EnablePrint = Is<PrintFeature>.Enabled;
    return View();
}
```
5. Add a json document in DocumentDB, either using the Data Explorer in the Azure Portal or the standalone Azure Storage Explorer (ASE) or through the client API of DocumentDB in order to turn on/off the feature. The document looks like this:
```json
{
   "id": "PrintFeature",
   "Enabled": false
}
```

### Provider Configuration 
In order to control how the `DocumentDbProvider` fetches feature toggles from DocumentDb, the provider can be configured through an instance of `DocumentDbConfiguration` passed to the overloaded static method `DocumentDbProvider.Configure(docDbConfig)`. 

The following options can be controlled through the configuration instance:
- `AuthKey` The authorization key for the Cosmos DB account.
- `ServiceEndpoint` The service endpoint for the Cosmos DB account.
- `DatabaseId` Database id (name) where toggles are stored. Defaults to **FeatureToggle**.
- `CollectionId` Document Collection id (name) where toggles are stored. Defaults to **Toggles**.
- `AutoCreateDatabaseAndCollection` Enable auto creation of database and collection for storing toggles. When set to true, the AuthKey must have permission to create database and collections. Defaults to **false**.
- `AutoCreateFeature` Enable auto creation of toggles as a json documents. When set to true, the AuthKey must have write permissions to the document collection. Defaults to **false**.

**NOTE: The id property the json document representing the feature toggle must match the name of the class representing the feature toggle.**

### DateTime based feature toggles
The `DocumentDbProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrBeforeDateFeatureToggle` and `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable on a specific date and time:
```c#
public class ComingSoonFeature : EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle
{
    public ComingSoonFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new DocumentDbProvider();
    }
}
```
The json document to control the feature toggle looks like this: 
```json
{
    "id": "ComingSoonFeature",
    "ToggleTimestamp": "2018-05-24T20:21:00"    
}
```
### Period based feature toggles
The `DocumentDbProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable during a specific period:
```c#
public class LimitedTimeFeature : EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle
{
    public LimitedTimeFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new DocumentDbProvider();
    }
}
```
The json document to control the feature toggle looks like this: 
```json
{
    "id": "LimitedTimeFeature",
    "Start": "2018-08-15T00:00:00",
    "End": "2018-08-20T23:59:59"    
}
```

## FeatureToggle.Azure.TableStorage
FeatureToggle provider for storing feature toggles as table entities in Azure Table storage (part of Azure Storage Accounts). The nuget package can be found on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle.Azure.TableStorage/).
### Getting started
1. Install `FeatureToggle.Azure.TableStorage` from nuget into your project.
2. Configure `TableStorageProvider` at application startup, such as in Global.asax or Startup.cs by specifying the connection string for the Azure Storage Account that will be used to store and retreive features toggles in Table storage. Global.asax example:
```c#
protected void Application_Start()
{
    // other startup configuration
    TableStorageProvider.Configure("[azurestorage_connectionstring]");
}
```
3. Add a class to your project representing the feature that needs to be controlled, e.g. `PrintFeature` and inherit from `TableStorageToggle`
```c#
public class PrintFeature : TableStorageToggle
{
}
```
4. Use the new feature toggle in your code to isolate features.
```c#
public ActionResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.EnablePrint = Is<PrintFeature>.Enabled;
    return View();
}
```
5. Add a table entity in Table storage, either using the Cloud Explorer in the Visual Studio or the standalone Azure Storage Explorer (ASE) or through the client API of Table storage in order to turn on/off the feature. The table entity must have the following properties:
- *PartitionKey:* Value must be the assembly name containing the feature toggle, unless overriden in configuration, see below.
- *RowKey:* Value must be the class name of the feature toggle.
- *Enabled:* true/false boolean value.
### Provider Configuration 
In order to control how the `TableStorageProvider` fetches feature toggles from Table Storage, the provider can be configured through an instance of `TableStorageConfiguration` passed to the overloaded static method `TableStorageProvider.Configure(tableStorageconfig)`.

The following options can be controlled through the configuration instance:
- `ConnectionString` The connection string to the storage account for Azure Table Storage.
- `TableName` The table name where toggles are stored. Defaults to **FeatureToggles**.
- `AutoCreateTable` Enable auto creation of the table storing toggles. When set to true, the connection string SAS token must have permission to create tables. Defaults to **false**.
- `AutoCreateFeature` Enable auto creation of toggles as table entities. When set to true, the connection string SAS token must have write permissions to the table. Defaults to **false**.
- `PartitionKeyResolver` Provides the option to define the table partition key through a function. Defaults to the assembly name  containing the feature toggle.

**NOTE: The RowKey of the table entity representing the feature toggle must match the name of the class representing the feature toggle.**

### DateTime based feature toggles
The `TableStorageProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrBeforeDateFeatureToggle` and `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable on a specific date and time:
```c#
public class ComingSoonFeature : EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle
{
    public ComingSoonFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new TableStorageProvider();
    }
}
```
The table entity that controls the feature toggle must have a DateTime property called **ToggleTimestamp**.
### Period based feature toggles
The `TableStorageProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable during a specific period:
```c#
public class LimitedTimeFeature : EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle
{
    public LimitedTimeFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new TableStorageProvider();
    }
}
```
The table entity that controls the feature toggle must have a DateTime property called **Start** and a DateTime property called **End**.

## FeatureToggle.Azure.ServiceFabric
FeatureToggle provider for storing feature toggles in Service Fabric configuration packages (Settings.xml files). The nuget package can be found on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle.Azure.ServiceFabric/).

### Getting started
1. Install `FeatureToggle.Azure.ServiceFabric` from nuget into your project.
2. Add a class to your project representing the feature that needs to be controlled, e.g. `CoolNewFeatureToggle` and inherit from `ServiceFabricToggle`
```c#
public class CoolNewFeatureToggle : ServiceFabricToggle
{
}
```
3. Use the new feature toggle in your code to isolate features.
```c#
public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewData["Message"] = Is<CoolNewFeatureToggle>.Enabled ? "Cool Feature enabled" :-D" : "No cool feature for U :-["; 
    return View();
}
```
4. Add a configuration section and parameter to the Settings.xml file in PackageRoot\Config folder in order to turn on/off the feature. Like so: 
```xml
<Section Name="Features">
    <Parameter Name="FeatureToggle.CoolNewFeatureToggle" Value="true" />
</Section>
```
### Provider Configuration 
If needed it is possible to control how and where the `ServiceFabricConfigProvider` fetches features toggles from SF configuration packages. The provider can be configured using the static method `Configure` which must be done when the Service Fabric service starts. The following parameters can be set:
- `configPackageName` The name of the Service Fabric configuration package. Defaults to **Config**.
- `configSectionName` The configuration section name in Settings.xml that hold feature toggles. Defaults to **Features**.
- `usePrefix` Controls whether features toggles must be prefixed with **FeatureToggle.** Defaults to **true**.

**NOTE: The parameter name attribute in Settings.xml representing the feature toggle must match the name of the class representing the feature toggle, and unless disabled (see above) it must be prefixed with FeatureToggle.**

### DateTime based feature toggles
The `ServiceFabricConfigProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrBeforeDateFeatureToggle` and `FeatureToggle.EnabledOnOrAfterDateFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable on a specific date and time:
```c#

{
    public ComingSoonFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new ServiceFabricConfigProvider();
    }
}
```
The Settings.xml config file that controls the feature toggle looks like this: 
```xml
<Section Name="Features">
    <Parameter Name="FeatureToggle.ComingSoonFeature" Value="24-May-2018 20:44:00" />
</Section>
```
### Period based feature toggles
The `ServiceFabricConfigProvider` supports feature toggles such as `FeatureToggle.EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle`, part of the [FeatureToggle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FeatureToggle) package, that must be installed seperately from the provider.

Example of a feature toggle that will enable during a specific period:
```c#
public class LimitedTimeFeature : EnabledBetweenDatesFeatureToggle
{
    public LimitedTimeFeature()
    {
        this.ToggleValueProvider = new ServiceFabricConfigProvider();
    }
}
```
The Settings.xml config file that controls the feature toggle looks like this: 
```xml
<Section Name="Features">
    <Parameter Name="FeatureToggle.LimitedTimeFeature" Value="15-Aug-2018 00:00:00 | 20-Aug-2018 23:59:59" />
</Section>
```

## Samples
The samples folder contains a single *Samples.sln* solution containing samples of the 3 FeatureToggle providers from the **FeatureToggle.Azure** packages. In order try these out locally, the following must be installed:
- Service Fabric SDK with local cluster setup which can be downloaded through [Web Platform Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx)
- [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator)
- [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator)

### ASP.NET Web App sample
The project *WebApplication* is a standard ASP.NET Web App (.NET Framework) showing how to configure and use **FeatureToggle.Azure.DocumentDB** and **FeatureToggle.Azure.TableStorage**. The configuration of the providers is located in the `Global.asax.cs`file. Both providers are configured for using local emulators with auto creation of storage and toggles.

Feature toggles are found in the FeatureToggles folder and are used in the `HomeController`. 
- The `FrontPageUIFeature` is a boolean FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Front page of the web app and is stored in Table Storage (emulator). 
- The `AboutPageFeature` is a boolean FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the About page of the web app and is stored in DocumentDb (emulator). 
- The `ComingSoonFeature` is a DateTime FeatureToggle, and  toggles a message on the the Front page of the web app and is stored in DocumentDb (emulator). 
- The `RetiringSoonFeature` is a DateTime FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Contact page of the web app and is stored in Table Storage (emulator). 
- The `LimitedTimeFeature` is a Period FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Front page of the web app and is stored in Table Storage (emulator). 

In order to change the toggle values after creation, you can use the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio or the Azure Storage Explorer.

### ASP.NET Core sample running in Service Fabric
The project *SfWebAppCore* is a ASP.NET Core Web App packaged as a Service Fabric application (the *ServiceFabricApplication* project). This sample shows how to configure and use **FeatureToggle.Azure.ServiceFabric**. The optional configuration of the provider is located in the `Startup.cs` file. The configuration package is located in PackageRoot/Config/Settings.xml file of the *SfWebAppCore* project.

Feature toggles are found in the FeatureToggles folder and are used in the `HomeController`. 
- The `CoolNewFeatureToggle` is a boolean FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the About page of the web app. 
- The `ComingSoonFeature` is a DateTime FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Front page of the web app. 
- The `RetiringSoonFeature` is a DateTime FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Contact page of the web app. 
- The `LimitedTimeFeature` is a Period FeatureToggle, and toggles a message on the Front page of the web app. 

In order to toggle the value, the configuration package must be [packaged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-package-apps) and [deployed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications) to the local cluster.
